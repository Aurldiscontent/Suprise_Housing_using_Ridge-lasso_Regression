# SUPRISE HOUSING CASE STUDY USING RIDGE AND LASSO REGRESSION
The Surprise Housing using Ridge & Lasso Regression project involved an in-depth analysis of housing prices using Machine Learning techniques. The journey began with data cleaning, handling missing values, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the key factors influencing house prices. Through visualizations and statistical insights, crucial relationships between features were identified, ensuring a well-structured dataset for model training. This case study not only enhanced my data preprocessing skills but also allowed me to apply feature selection techniques, ensuring that only the most relevant variables contributed to the predictive models.

The core focus of this project was implementing Ridge and Lasso Regression, which are advanced regularization techniques that prevent overfitting while improving model performance. By comparing these models, I gained insights into how L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization impact feature selection and model accuracy. Fine-tuning hyperparameters and evaluating model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE) enabled the development of a more reliable house price prediction system. This project provided hands-on experience in predictive modeling, reinforcing my understanding of machine learning workflows and their real-world applications in the housing market.
